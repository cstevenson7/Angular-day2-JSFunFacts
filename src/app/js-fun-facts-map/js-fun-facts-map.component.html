<h2>JavaScript Map Function</h2>

<p> The map function only works with arrays and it creates a new array. <br>A function is executed on each element in the array, and the results are stored in the new array. <br> For example, an array of Celsius temperatures could be converted to Fahrenheit temperatures.    </p>
